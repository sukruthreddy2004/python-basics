# Python Basics

This repository contains my beginner-to-intermediate Python exercises, including:

- Variables  
- Data types  
- If, elif, else  
- Nested if statements  
- Strings (indexing, slicing, methods)
- Loops  
- Basic programs and practice exercises

This repo will grow as I continue learning Python daily.
